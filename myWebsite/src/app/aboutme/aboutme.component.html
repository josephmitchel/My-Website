        <p class="description">
          My name is Joseph Mitchell and I'm a Software Engineer based in New York City. 
          I'm originally from Washington, DC and recently graduated from Boston University with a degree in Computer Science. 
          Currently, I work at Matrix Applications LLC, a fintech leader in the fixed income capital markets, where I work on front-end development and data visualization.

          Outside of work, I enjoy staying active through exercise as best as I can by working out, playing tennis, and indoor bouldering.
          Additionally, I love practicing guitar, writing my own music, and playing video games.
