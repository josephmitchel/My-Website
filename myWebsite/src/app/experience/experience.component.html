                    I initially joined the Matrix Applications team as an intern in the summer of 2023 where I helped develop a new dataload deployment application for the company.
                    I am now currently employed as a full-time software engineer where I work on a variety of projects including the development of a new data visualization tool.

                    I spent some of my time at Boston University working at the Student Philanthropy Center as a part-time telecommunications assistant. 
                    I helped out with fundraising for the university, marketing events, and training new hires.

                    Throughout all of High School and College I helped out as a part-time office assistant at TenniStar, a small sports organization based in the DMV area.
                    I worked directly with the president of the comapny, helping with administrative tasks, scheduling, and customer service.
